<p style="padding-left: 1cm"> Basketball: I started playing basket in the 7th grade, I played the
Shooting Guard/
Small Forward position. In middle school I wasn't really that good and end up getting cut from
the team and ended up playing rec ball,
but that didn't stop me from not wanting to play it just push me to want to be better. So I used
to go outside and work on the the little
things and put them to the test in pickup games, then freshman year I eventually made the
team but after that I was back to square one so I just played summer ball for the school.
When it comes to basketball I would say im more of athletic defensive type player because I
have tremendous natural athleticism and my defense is better than my offense.
My favorit player to watch is Russell Westbrook </p>

<p style="padding-left: 1cm"> Football: Senior year I wanted to try something new so I picked
up football and played for the team. I got tryout many different positions on defense,
but I mostly played Safety and some Nose Guard, I played safety because I was very fast and
could cover a lot of ground in the fewest amount of seconds and I don't really know why
 I played Nose I didn't even have the size or the strength for the position but somehow I
manage to hold my own, I find myself to be very elusive and I somehow always found a way to
get through the offensive line.
My favorite players are Julio Jones and Mike Vick. </p>

alt="" style="width:304px;height:300px;"/>
<p style="padding-left: 1cm"> Track: I started track in 7th grade, I wasn't really into it at first
but if I wasn't for my middle school coach pestering me to join the team everyday
and my name on the roster when track season came causing me to join instantly because I
ain't no quitter, I probably wouldn't have never discovered the sport where I could put my raw
athleticism to the test and eventually tune it into something more.
In track I mostly did all jumping events, 100m dash,110m hurdles, relays, and some mid
distances (I dont know why I hate distance running) 300m hurdles. In track I would say I hated
practices because they we always so boring and always changing,
so I never knew what to prepare for but as result I would have to say those practices made me
pretty good. If I were to try to go D1 then track would be the key to getting me into being a D1
athlete. In high school I went to KVACs every year and
 went to states my junior year but didn't try go senior year cause I didn't want to be late for my
graduation and have to wear my uniform under my cap & gund, also senior year started to feel
less fun and more like a chore cause my coach change dramatically that year.
 </p>
<br><center><img src = "big papi.jpg"
alt="" style="width:404px;height:300px;"/>
<p style="padding-left: 1cm"> Baseball: I started baseball in the 2nd grade and played till
sophomore year in Little League. I played second base and mostly right field cause of my
speed. During my years of little league I've won 3 championships
and made the All Star team once in 7th grade and went to states. I didn't play baseball in high
school because it was during the same time as track season., but now that I look back on it I
should have done both in high school.
 I've had some great memories playing with the boys like when I hit my first homerun, and have
rap battles and roast offs in the dugout at practice.

<p style="padding-left: 1cm">
<br><center><img src = "runner.jpg"
alt="" style="width:404px;height:300px;"/>
<p style="padding-left: 1cm">When it comes to sports I play for the competitiveness,my own
ambition, and for memories and bonds.
As a kid I losing always hated losing whenever there was a prize involved. Growing up with
competitive siblings everything turned into a competition,
whether if its the most simplest tasks like see who can stay up the longest, to staring
competitions, or harder stuff like seeing who has the more raw athleticism.
I play sport to set the bar when it come to my ambition of becoming rich, when I say setting the
bar I mean never settling for the less like being the worst player
on the team but to shoot for top. I play sports for the memories and bonds with friends, theres
nothing like looking back on all the roasts and the memories of seeing each other cool stuff

on the courts or field.

<p><b><center><h1 style="color:black;"> Why Sports Agent</h1></center></b></p>
<br><center><img src = "Cash-Loan.jpg"
alt="" style="width:404px;height:300px;"/>
<p style="padding-left: 1cm"> I chose sports agent as a career path because I've always been
around sports and because of my ambition to become rich. I felt it would be weird for me if I
had to learn
something totally different, which isn't that bad but spend my life playing catch up just to be in
a good position since
others will already have much of ahead start in front of me.

<p><b><center><h1 style="color:black;"> About Me</h1></center></b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 1cm">

My name is Christopher Gabrielsen, but most people call me Chris. I was born in Stonybrook university, I grew up in the town of Southampton on the east end of Long Island. I live near the beach so my summers were mostly filled with swimming in the Atlantic Ocean, and working. This past summer I cleaned and repaired pools for my neighbor’s company Rachel Lynch. I also valeted for private parties all over the island. An exciting part about my jobs is getting to work for millionaires, and famous people Beyoncé, Robert Downy Jr, and Alex Rodriguez to name a few. My hobbies and interests include snowboarding, longboarding, and working out. My major is business management, I chose this major because my Eagle Scout project inspired me to explore the field. My project was raising the height of a bulkhead at my towns local shellfish hatchery, to reduce pollution into the breeding grounds of the shellfish. My most memorable adventure was when I was fortunate enough to tag along with my friend and his family to go snowboarding in Austria. We snowboarded in the town of Kitzbuhel which is located right at the base of a ski resort. The picture at the bottom of the page is the kind of terrain I would ride. The views were incredible and I would love to go back someday.  </p>

<p style="padding-left: 1cm"> My music interests are not very limited, I like all music except for country and gospel. My favorite bands and artists include Pink Floyd, The Greatfull Dead, Kahlid, 21 Savage, J. Cole, and Billy Jole. My mom sings in a Greatfull Dead cover band with her fiance who plays the keyboard. She introduced me to the Greatfull Dead when I was young, she always played classic rock and a varity of "hippie" music in long car rides up to the ski mountain. Recently I enjoy more modern music such as J. Cole 21 Savage, and Kahlid my all time favorie album is 2014 Forest Hills Drive by J. Cole.   </p>

<p style="padding-left: 1cm"> Snowboarding has been a passion of mine since I was eight years old, but I have been around ski mountians my entire life. My family used to take the sport very serioulsy. When I was two my started mom skiing with me on her back before I could even walk. Eventuslly I graduated to the leash, and soon riding solo. Out of my three cousins I was the only skiier and I was always interested in the was my cousins carved the mountain with their boards. After turning eight I asked my parents if I could give snowboarding a try, reluctantly they agreed and it has been a passion of mine ever since.    </p>

<p style="padding-left: 1cm">One of the items on my bucket list was to snowboard in Europe, last year during my spring break that dream was made into a reality. One of my best friends invited me to Austria to ski with him and his father. After the tediious eight hour flight we finally landed in Munchen Germany, we rented a car and drove an additional four hours to Kitzbuhel which is located in Austria. We made several stops along the way including the BMW museum, and various shopping centers. The town of Kitzbuhel is located at the base of the mountain, so we literally walked from our room stright to the lift. We spent four days skiing some of the freshest and most beautiful terrain in Europe skiing for miles on end. It was deffinatly one of the best exeriences of my life.

<p style="padding-left: 1cm"> I chose Bussiness Management as a major  because my Eagle Scout project inspired me to explore the field. My project was raising the height of a bulkhead at my towns local shellfish hatchery. The shellfish hatchery breeds oysters to clean the water, then sells them to the town. The bulkhead needed to be raised to eliminate pollution that was being washed out into the breeding grounds, making the oysters sick. I had to manage a budget, materials, workers, tools, and everyone’s safety. I enjoyed being in charge and watching my project rise from the ground up. Once all the pieces were in place I was left with a finished product that I managed all by myself. Looking back on it I enjoyed most of process of managing a project which is why I chose this major.
