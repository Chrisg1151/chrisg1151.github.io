My name is Christopher Gabrielsen, but most people call me Chris. I was born in Stonybrook university, I grew up in the town of Southampton on the east end of Long Island. I live near the beach so my summers were mostly filled with swimming in the Atlantic Ocean, and working. This past summer I cleaned and repaired pools for my neighbor’s company Rachel Lynch. I also valeted for private parties all over the island. An exciting part about my jobs is getting to work for millionaires, and famous people Beyoncé, Robert Downy Jr, and Alex Rodriguez to name a few. My hobbies and interests include snowboarding, longboarding, and working out. My major is business management, I chose this major because my Eagle Scout project inspired me to explore the field. My project was raising the height of a bulkhead at my towns local shellfish hatchery, to reduce pollution into the breeding grounds of the shellfish. My most memorable adventure was when I was fortunate enough to tag along with my friend and his family to go snowboarding in Austria. We snowboarded in the town of Kitzbuhel which is located right at the base of a ski resort. The picture at the bottom of the page is the kind of terrain I would ride. The views were incredible and I would love to go back someday.  </p>
