Hello, my name is Chris Gabrielsen. I am a student at the University of Maine majoring in busniess managment. I grew up in the town of Southampton on the east end of Long Island. My hobbies include snowboarding, longboarding, and cooking. I have been snowboarding since the age of eight, and it is my favorite hobby. I was fourtinate enough to travel in Europe and snowboard in the town of Kitzbuhel Austria. The picture at the bottom is the type of terrain I snowboarded on my trip.I enjoy traveling and eventually I would like to fill my passport with a variety of different destinations.  </p>
